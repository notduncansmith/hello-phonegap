# Cordova/PhoneGap sqlite storage adapter

Native interface to sqlite in a Cordova/PhoneGap plugin for Android, iOS, Windows (8.1), Amazon Fire-OS, and WP(7/8) with API similar to HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/).

License for Android, Windows (8.1), Amazon Fire-OS, and WP(7/8) versions: MIT or Apache 2.0

License for iOS version: MIT only

## Status

- [Stable version available at PhoneGap build](https://build.phonegap.com/plugins/2368)
- Windows (8.1) version is in experimental state (sqlite `3.8.8.3` embedded):
  - No background processing
  - Database close and delete operations not yet implemented
  - insertId and rowsAffected are missing in the results for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements
  - Visual C++ build file is provided for Windows 8.1 only. Visual C++ build support for Windows Phone 8.1 to be added later.
  - Not all Windows CPU targets are supported by automatic installation
- Status for the other target platforms:
  - Android: now using the [sqlite4java](https://code.google.com/p/sqlite4java/) library (sqlite `3.8.7` embedded) - [Android closing/locking issue (#193)](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/193) should now be solved
  - iOS: sqlite `3.8.8.3` embedded
  - WP7: possible to build from C#, as specified by `plugin.xml` - **NOT TESTED**
  - WP8: performance/stability issues have been reported with the CSharp-SQLite library. Windows (universal) platform is recommended for the future.
- API to open the database may be changed somewhat to be more streamlined. Transaction and single-statement query API will NOT be changed.

## Announcements

- Android version is now using the [sqlite4java](https://code.google.com/p/sqlite4java/) library:
  - NDK part rebuilt with `-DSQLITE_TEMP_STORE=3` CFLAG to support UPDATE properly;
  - workaround to [Android closing/locking issue (#193)](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/193) is no longer necessary and has been removed.
- iOS version is now fixed to override the correct pluginInitialize method and should work with recent versions of iOS
- Project has been renamed to prevent confusion with [davibe / Phonegap-SQLitePlugin](https://github.com/davibe/Phonegap-SQLitePlugin) (original version for iOS, with a different API)
- New project location (should redirect)
- Discussion forum at [Ost.io / @litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-storage](http://ost.io/@litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage)
- Windows (8.1) version is added, using the C++ SQLite-WinRT library
- The test suite is completely ported to Jasmine (2.2.0) and was used to verify the functionality of the new Windows version
- [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) for Windows (8.1) in addition to Android & iOS is now supported by [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter)
- New `openDatabase` and `deleteDatabase` `location` option to select database location (iOS *only*) and disable iCloud backup
- Pre-populated databases support for Android, iOS, and Amazon Fire-OS is now integrated, usage described below
- Fixes to work with PouchDB by [@nolanlawson](https://github.com/nolanlawson)

## Highlights

- Works with Cordova 3.x tooling and [stable version available at PhoneGap build](https://build.phonegap.com/plugins/2368)
- Drop-in replacement for HTML5 SQL API, the only change should be `window.openDatabase()` --> `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`
- Failure-safe nested transactions with batch processing optimizations
- As described in [this posting](http://brodyspark.blogspot.com/2012/12/cordovaphonegap-sqlite-plugins-offer.html):
  - Keeps sqlite database in a user data location that is known; can be reconfigured (iOS version); and synchronized to iCloud by default (iOS version; can be disabled as described below).
  - No 5MB maximum, more information at: http://www.sqlite.org/limits.html
- Android is supported back to SDK 10 (a.k.a. Gingerbread, Android 2.3.3); support for older versions is available upon request.
- Pre-populated database option (usage described below)

## Known issues

- Issue reported with PhoneGap Build Hydration.
- Multi-page apps are not supported and known to be broken on Android and Amazon Fire-OS.
- Using web workers is currently not supported and known to be broken on Android and Amazon Fire-OS.
- Triggers have only been tested on iOS, known to be broken on Amazon Fire-OS.
- INSERT statement that affects multiple rows (due to SELECT cause or using triggers, for example) does not report proper rowsAffected on Amazon Fire-OS.
- For Windows (8.1), insertId and rowsAffected are missing in the results for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements.

## Other limitations

- The db version, display name, and size parameter values are not supported and will be ignored.
- This plugin will not work before the callback for the "deviceready" event has been fired, as described in **Usage**. (This is consistent with the other Cordova plugins.)
- The Android and Amazon Fire-OS versions cannot work with more than 100 open db files due to the threading model.
- UNICODE line separator (`\u2028`) is currently not supported and known to be broken in iOS version.
- UNICODE characters not working in WP(7/8) version
- Blob type is currently not supported and known to be broken on multiple platforms.
- UNICODE `\u0000` (same as `\0`) character not working in Windows (8.1) or WP(7/8) versions
- Case-insensitive matching and other string manipulations on Unicode characters, which is provided by optional ICU integration in the sqlite source and working with recent versions of Android, is not supported for any target platforms.

## Limited support (testing needed)

- DB Triggers (as described above - known to be broken for Amazon Fire-OS)
- UNICODE characters not fully tested in the Windows (8.1) version

## Other versions

- [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlcipher-adapter) - supports [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) for Android, iOS, and Windows (8.1)
- Original version for iOS (with a different API): [davibe / Phonegap-SQLitePlugin](https://github.com/davibe/Phonegap-SQLitePlugin)

## Other SQLite adapter projects

- [EionRobb / phonegap-win8-sqlite](https://github.com/EionRobb/phonegap-win8-sqlite) - WebSQL add-on for Win8/Metro apps (perhaps with a different API), using an old version of the C++ library from [SQLite3-WinRT Component](https://github.com/doo/SQLite3-WinRT) (as referenced by [01org / cordova-win8](https://github.com/01org/cordova-win8))
- [SQLite3-WinRT Component](https://github.com/doo/SQLite3-WinRT) - C++ component that provides a nice SQLite API with promises for WinJS
- [01org / cordova-win8](https://github.com/01org/cordova-win8) - old, unofficial version of Cordova API support for Windows 8 Metro that includes an old version of the C++ [SQLite3-WinRT Component](https://github.com/doo/SQLite3-WinRT)
- [MSOpenTech / cordova-plugin-websql](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/cordova-plugin-websql) - Windows 8(+) and Windows Phone 8(+) WebSQL plugin versions in C#
- [MetaMemoryT / websql-client](https://github.com/MetaMemoryT/websql-client) - provides the same API and connects to [websql-server](https://github.com/MetaMemoryT/websql-server) through WebSockets.

# Usage

The idea is to emulate the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) as closely as possible. The only major change is to use `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()` (or `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`) instead of `window.openDatabase()`. If you see any other major change please report it, it is probably a bug.

## Opening a database

There are two options to open a database:
- Recommended: `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", location: 1});`
- Classical: `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase("myDatabase.db", "1.0", "Demo", -1);`

The new `location` option is used to select the database subdirectory location (iOS *only*) with the following choices:
- `0` (default): `Documents` - visible to iTunes and backed up by iCloud
- `1`: `Library` - backed up by iCloud, *NOT* visible to iTunes
- `2`: `Library/LocalDatabase` - *NOT* visible to iTunes and *NOT* backed up by iCloud

**IMPORTANT:** Please wait for the "deviceready" event, as in the following example:

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db"});
  // ...
}
```

**NOTE:** The database file name should include the extension, if desired.

### Pre-populated database

For Android, iOS, and Amazon Fire-OS (*only*): put the database file in the `www` directory and open the database like:

```js
var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", createFromLocation: 1});
```

or to disable iCloud backup:

```js
db = sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", location: 2, createFromLocation: 1});
```

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Put the pre-populated database file in the `www` subdirectory. This should work well with using the Cordova CLI to support both Android & iOS versions.
- The pre-populated database file name must match **exactly** the file name given in `openDatabase`. The automatic extension has been completely eliminated.
- The pre-populated database file is ignored if the database file with the same name already exists in your database file location.

**TIP:** If you don't see the data from the pre-populated database file, completely remove your app and try it again!

## Background processing

The threading model depends on which version is used:
- For Android, Amazon Fire-OS, and WP(7/8), one background thread per db;
- for iOS, background processing using a thread pool;
- for Windows, no background processing (to be added in the near future).

# Sample with PRAGMA feature

This is a pretty strong test: first we create a table and add a single entry, then query the count to check if the item was inserted as expected. Note that a new transaction is created in the middle of the first callback.

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db"});

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');

    // demonstrate PRAGMA:
    db.executeSql("pragma table_info (test_table);", [], function(res) {
      console.log("PRAGMA res: " + JSON.stringify(res));
    });

    tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)", ["test", 100], function(tx, res) {
      console.log("insertId: " + res.insertId + " -- probably 1");
      console.log("rowsAffected: " + res.rowsAffected + " -- should be 1");

      db.transaction(function(tx) {
        tx.executeSql("select count(id) as cnt from test_table;", [], function(tx, res) {
          console.log("res.rows.length: " + res.rows.length + " -- should be 1");
          console.log("res.rows.item(0).cnt: " + res.rows.item(0).cnt + " -- should be 1");
        });
      });

    }, function(e) {
      console.log("ERROR: " + e.message);
    });
  });
}
```

## Sample with transaction-level nesting

In this case, the same transaction in the first executeSql() callback is being reused to run executeSql() again.

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase("Database", "1.0", "Demo", -1);

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');

    tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)", ["test", 100], function(tx, res) {
      console.log("insertId: " + res.insertId + " -- probably 1");
      console.log("rowsAffected: " + res.rowsAffected + " -- should be 1");

      tx.executeSql("select count(id) as cnt from test_table;", [], function(tx, res) {
        console.log("res.rows.length: " + res.rows.length + " -- should be 1");
        console.log("res.rows.item(0).cnt: " + res.rows.item(0).cnt + " -- should be 1");
      });

    }, function(e) {
      console.log("ERROR: " + e.message);
    });
  });
}
```

This case will also works with Safari (WebKit), assuming you replace `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase` with `window.openDatabase`.

## Delete a database

```js
window.sqlitePlugin.deleteDatabase({name: "my.db", location: 1}, successcb, errorcb);
```

`location` as described above for `openDatabase` (iOS *only*)

**NOTE:** not yet implemented for Windows (8.1) version.

# Installing

## Windows target platform

**WARNING:** This is still in experimental state. Please read and follow these items very carefully.
- Please make sure your Cordova tooling is updated: `npm update -g cordova cordova-windows`
- To create a new project: `cordova create MyProjectFolder com.my.project MyProject` (and then `cd` into your project directory)
- To add the plugin: `cordova plugin add https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage`
- To add the Windows target platform (if it does not exist): `cordova platform add windows`
- If you are using Visual Studio Express (2013), you may have to remove the Windows 8.0 build from the Visual Studio solution.
- If you use Cordova CLI for fully-automatic installation (as described here), you cannot run the project for "Any CPU". Please specify a CPU type (such as x86 or x64).

To target all CPUs: make a clone of this project and in your clone, remove (or comment out) the item that includes the `SQLite3-Windows8.1.vcxproj` framework project:
```xml
--- a/plugin.xml
+++ b/plugin.xml
@@ -79,8 +79,6 @@
         <js-module src="src/windows/SQLite3-WinRT/SQLite3JS/js/SQLite3.js" name="SQLite3">

     </platform>
```

Then:
- install the plugin from the location of your clone (can be in your filesystem);
- add the Cordova `windows` target;
- open the Windows target solution, and add the `SQLite3-Windows8.1.vcxproj` project (located in `path.to.plugin/src/windows/SQLite3-WinRT/SQLite3`) to your app solution project.

## Easy install with plugman tool

```shell
plugman install --platform MYPLATFORM --project path.to.my.project.folder --plugin https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage
```

where MYPLATFORM is `android`, `ios`, or `wp8`.

A posting how to get started developing on Windows host without the Cordova CLI tool (for Android target only) is available [here](http://brodybits.blogspot.com/2015/03/trying-cordova-for-android-on-windows-without-cordova-cli.html).

**NOTE:** Automatic installation for the Windows target platform is *not* properly supported by the `plugman` tool.

## Easy install with Cordova CLI tool

    npm install -g cordova # if you don't have cordova
    cordova create MyProjectFolder com.my.project MyProject && cd MyProjectFolder # if you are just starting
    cordova plugin add https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage

You can find more details at [this writeup](http://iphonedevlog.wordpress.com/2014/04/07/installing-chris-brodys-sqlite-database-with-cordova-cli-android/).

**WARNING:** for Windows target platform please read the section above.

**IMPORTANT:** sometimes you have to update the version for a platform before you can build, like: `cordova prepare ios`

**NOTE:** If you cannot build for a platform after `cordova prepare`, you may have to remove the platform and add it again, such as:

    cordova platform rm ios
    cordova platform add ios

## Source tree

- `SQLitePlugin.coffee.md`: platform-independent (Literate coffee-script, can be read by recent coffee-script compiler)
- `www`: `SQLitePlugin.js` platform-independent Javascript as generated from `SQLitePlugin.coffee.md` (and checked in!)
- `src`: platform-specific source code:
   - `android` - Java plugin code for Android (along with sqlite4java library);
   - `android-classic` - Java plugin code for Amazon Fire-OS
   - `ios` - Objective-C plugin code for iOS;
   - `windows` - Javascript proxy code and SQLite3-WinRT project for Windows (8.1);
   - `wp` - C-sharp code for WP(7/8)
- `spec`: test suite using Jasmine (2.2.0), ported from QUnit `test-www` test suite, working on all platforms
- `Lawnchair-adapter`: Lawnchair adaptor, based on the version from the Lawnchair repository, with the basic Lawnchair test suite in `test-www` subdirectory

## Manual installation - Android version

These installation instructions are based on the Android example project from Cordova/PhoneGap 2.7.0. For your first time please unzip the PhoneGap 2.7 zipball and use the `lib/android/example` subdirectory.

 - Install `SQLitePlugin.js` from `www` into `assets/www`
 - Install src/android/org/pgsqlite/SQLitePlugin.java from this repository into src/org/pgsqlite subdirectory
 - Install the `libs` subtree from `src/android/sqlite4java/libs` into your Android project
 - Add the plugin element `<plugin name="SQLitePlugin" value="org.pgsqlite.SQLitePlugin"/>` to res/xml/config.xml

Sample change to `res/xml/config.xml` for Cordova/PhoneGap 2.x:

Before building for the first time, you have to update the project with the desired version of the Android SDK with a command like:

    android update project --path $(pwd) --target android-19

(assuming Android SDK 19, use the correct desired Android SDK number here)

**NOTE:** using this plugin on Cordova pre-3.0 requires the following change to SQLitePlugin.java:

## Manual installation - iOS version

### SQLite library

In the Project "Build Phases" tab, select the _first_ "Link Binary with Libraries" dropdown menu and add the library `libsqlite3.dylib` or `libsqlite3.0.dylib`.

**NOTE:** In the "Build Phases" there can be multiple "Link Binary with Libraries" dropdown menus. Please select the first one otherwise it will not work.

### SQLite Plugin

- Copy `SQLitePlugin.[hm]` from `src/ios` into your project Plugins folder and add them in XCode (I always just have "Create references" as the option selected).
- Copy `SQLitePlugin.js` from `www` into your project `www` folder
- Enable the SQLitePlugin in `config.xml`

# Common traps & pitfalls

- The plugin class name starts with "SQL" in capital letters, but in Javascript the `sqlitePlugin` object name starts with "sql" in small letters.
- Attempting to open a database before receiving the "deviceready" event callback.

# Support

## Reporting issues

If you have an issue with the plugin please check the following first:
- You are using the latest version of the Plugin Javascript & platform-specific Java or Objective-C source from this repository.
- You have installed the Javascript & platform-specific Java or Objective-C correctly.
- You have included the correct version of the cordova Javascript and SQLitePlugin.js and got the path right.
- You have registered the plugin properly in `config.xml`.

If you still cannot get something to work:
- Make the simplest test program you can to demonstrate the issue, including the following characteristics:
  - it completely self-contained, i.e. it is using no extra libraries beyond cordova & SQLitePlugin.js;
  - if the issue is with *adding* data to a table, that the test program includes the statements you used to open the database and create the table;
  - if the issue is with *retrieving* data from a table, that the test program includes the statements you used to open the database, create the table, and enter the data you are trying to retrieve.

Then you can [raise the new issue](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/new).

## Community forum

If you have any questions about the plugin please post them to the new discussion forum at [Ost.io / @litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-storage](http://ost.io/@litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage).

# Unit tests

Unit testing is done in `spec`.

## running tests from shell

To run the tests from \*nix shell, simply do either:
 
    ./bin/test.sh ios

or for Android:

    ./bin/test.sh android

To run then from a windows powershell do either

    .\bin\test.ps1 android

or for Windows (8.1):

    .\bin\test.ps1 windows

or for Windows Phone (7/8):

    .\bin\test.ps1 wp8

# Adapters

## Lawnchair Adapter

### Common adapter

Please look at the `Lawnchair-adapter` tree that contains a common adapter, which should also work with the Android version, along with a test-www directory.

### Included files

Include the following Javascript files in your HTML:

- `cordova.js` (don't forget!)
- `lawnchair.js` (you provide)
- `SQLitePlugin.js` (in case of Cordova pre-3.0)
- `Lawnchair-sqlitePlugin.js` (must come after `SQLitePlugin.js` in case of Cordova pre-3.0)

### Sample

The `name` option determines the sqlite database filename, *with no extension automatically added*. Optionally, you can change the db filename using the `db` option.

In this example, you would be using/creating a database with filename `kvstore`:

```Javascript
kvstore = new Lawnchair({name: "kvstore"}, function() {
  // do stuff
);
```

Using the `db` option you can specify the filename with the desired extension and be able to create multiple stores in the same database file. (There will be one table per store.)

```Javascript
recipes = new Lawnchair({db: "cookbook", name: "recipes", ...}, myCallback());
ingredients = new Lawnchair({db: "cookbook", name: "ingredients", ...}, myCallback());
```

**KNOWN ISSUE:** the new db options are *not* supported by the Lawnchair adapter. The workaround is to first open the database file using `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`.

## PouchDB

The adapter is now part of [PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com/) thanks to [@nolanlawson](https://github.com/nolanlawson), see [PouchDB FAQ](http://pouchdb.com/faq.html).

# Contributing

**WARNING:** Please do NOT propose changes from your `master` branch. In general, contributions are rebased using `git rebase` or `git cherry-pick` and not merged.

- Testimonials of apps that are using this plugin would be especially helpful.
- Reporting issues at [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-storage / issues](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues) can help improve the quality of this plugin.
- Patches with bug fixes are helpful, especially when submitted with test code.
- Other enhancements welcome for consideration, when submitted with test code and are working for all supported platforms. Increase of complexity should be avoided.
- All contributions may be reused by [@brodybits (Chris Brody)](https://github.com/brodybits) under another license in the future. Efforts will be taken to give credit for major contributions but it will not be guaranteed.
- Project restructuring, i.e. moving files and/or directories around, should be avoided if possible.
- If you see a need for restructuring, it is better to first discuss it in the forum at [Ost.io / @litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-storage](http://ost.io/@litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage) (or in a [new issue](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/new)) where alternatives can be discussed before reaching a conclusion. If you want to propose a change to the project structure:
  - Remember to make (and use) a special branch within your fork from which you can send the proposed restructuring;
  - Always use `git mv` to move files & directories;
  - Never mix a move/rename operation with any other changes in the same commit.
